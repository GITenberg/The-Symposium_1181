          Xenophon the Athenian was born 431 B.C. He was a
          pupil of Socrates. He marched with the Spartans,
          and was exiled from Athens. Sparta gave him land
          and property in Scillus, where he lived for many
          years before having to move once more, to settle
          in Corinth. He died in 354 B.C.

          The Symposium records the discussion of Socrates
          and company at a dinner given by Callias for the
          youth Autolycus. Dakyns believed that Plato knew
          of this work, and that it influenced him to some
          degree when he wrote his own "Symposium."

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> I
    </p>
    <p>
      For myself, (1) I hold to the opinion that not alone are the serious
      transactions of "good and noble men" (2) most memorable, but that words
      and deeds distinctive of their lighter moods may claim some record. (3) In
      proof of which contention, I will here describe a set of incidents within
      the scope of my experience. (4)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (1) See Aristid. ii. foll.

 (2) Or, "nature's noblemen."

 (3) Cf. Plut. "Ages." 29 (Clough, iv. 35): "And indeed if, as Xenophon
    says, in conversation good men, even in their sports and at their
    wine, let fall many sayings that are worth preserving." See Grote,
    "Plato," ii. 228 foll. as to the sportive character of the work.

 (4) Or, "let me describe a scene which I was witness of." See Hug.
    "Plat. Symp." p. xv. foll.
</pre>
    <p>
      The occasion was a horse-race (5) at the great Panathenaic festival. (6)
      Callias, (7) the son of Hipponicus, being a friend and lover of the boy
      Autolycus, (8) had brought the lad, himself the winner of the pankration,
      (9) to see the spectacle.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (5) See "Hipparch," ii. 1.

 (6) "Held towards the end of July (Hecatombaeon) every year, and with
    greater pomp every four years (the third of each Olympiad)."&mdash;Gow,
    84, 129, n.

 (7) Callias. Cobet, "Pros. X." p. 67 foll.; Boeckh, "P. E. A." p. 481.

 (8) See Cobet, op. cit. p. 54; Plut. "Lysand." 15 (Clough, iii. 120);
    Grote, "H. G." ix. 261.

 (9) 420 B.C., al. 421. The date is fixed by the "Autolycus" of
    Eupolis. See Athen. v. 216. For the pankration, which comprised
    wrestling and boxing, see Aristot. "Rhet." i. S. 14.
</pre>
    <p>
      As soon as the horse race was over, (10) Callias proceeded to escort
      Autolycus and his father, Lycon, to his house in the Piraeus, being
      attended also by Niceratus. (11) But catching sight of Socrates along with
      certain others (Critobulus, (12) Hermogenes, Antisthenes, and Charmides),
      he bade an attendant conduct the party with Autolycus, whilst he himself
      approached the group, exclaiming:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (10) See A. Martin, op. cit. p. 265.

 (11) Niceratus. See Cobet, op. cit. 71; Boeckh, "P. E. A." 480; Plat.
    "Lach." 200 C; "Hell." II. iii. 39; Lys. xviii.; Diod. xiv. 5.

 (12) Critobulus, Hermogenes, Antisthenes, Charmides. See "Mem."
</pre>
    <p>
      A happy chance brings me across your path, just when I am about to
      entertain Autolycus and his father at a feast. The splendour of the
      entertainment shall be much enhanced, I need not tell you, if my hall (13)
      should happily be graced by worthies like yourselves, who have attained to
      purity of soul, (14) rather than by generals and cavalry commanders (15)
      and a crowd of place-hunters. (16)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (13) Or, "dining-room." See Becker, "Charicles," 265.

 (14) See Grote, "H. G." viii. 619 foll. Cf. Plat. "Rep." 527 D;
    "Soph." 230 E.

 (15) Lit. Strategoi, Hipparchs.

 (16) Or, "petitioners for offices of state." Reading {spoudarkhiais}.
</pre>
    <p>
      Whereat Socrates: When will you have done with your gibes, Callias? Why,
      because you have yourself spent sums of money on Protagoras, (17) and
      Gorgias, and Prodicus, and a host of others, to learn wisdom, must you
      pour contempt on us poor fellows, who are but self-taught tinkers (18) in
      philosophy compared with you?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (17) As to Protagoras of Abdera, Gorgias of Leontini, Prodicus of
    Ceos, see Plat. "Prot." 314 C, "Rep." x. 600 C, "Apol." 19 E;
    "Anab." II. vi. 17; "Mem." II. i. 21; "Encyc. Brit." "Sophists,"
    H. Jackson.

 (18) Or, "hand-to-mouth cultivators of philosophy," "roturiers." Cf.
    Plat. "Rep." 565 A: "A third class who work for themselves"; Thuc.
    i. 141: "The Peloponnesians cultivate their own soil, and they
    have no wealth either public or private." Cf. "Econ." v. 4.
</pre>
    <p>
      Hitherto, no doubt (retorted Callias), although I had plenty of wise
      things to say, I have kept my wisdom to myself; but if only you will
      honour me with your company to-day, I promise to present myself in quite
      another light; you will see I am a person of no mean consideration after
      all. (19)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (19) Or, "I will prove to you that I am worthy of infinite respect."
</pre>
    <p>
      Socrates and the others, while thanking Callias politely for the
      invitation, were not disposed at first to join the dinner party; but the
      annoyance of the other so to be put off was so obvious that in the end the
      party were persuaded to accompany their host.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an interval devoted to gymnastic exercise (and subsequent anointing
      of the limbs) by some, whilst others of them took a bath, the guests were
      severally presented to the master of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Autolycus was seated next his father, as was natural, (20) while the rest
      reclined on couches. Noting the scene presented, the first idea to strike
      the mind of any one must certainly have been that beauty has by nature
      something regal in it; and the more so, if it chance to be combined (as
      now in the person of Autolycus) with modesty and self-respect. Even as
      when a splendid object blazes forth at night, the eyes of men are riveted,
      (21) so now the beauty of Autolycus drew on him the gaze of all; nor was
      there one of those onlookers but was stirred to his soul's depth by him
      who sat there. (22) Some fell into unwonted silence, while the gestures of
      the rest were equally significant.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (20) Al. "Autolycus found a seat beside his father, while the rest
    reclined on couches in the usual fashion." See Schneider's note.

 (21) Passage imitated by Max. Tyr. "Or." xxiv. 4.

 (22) Cf. Plat. "Charm." 154.
</pre>
    <p>
      It seems the look betokening divine possession, no matter who the god,
      must ever be remarkable. Only, whilst the subject of each commoner emotion
      passion-whirled may be distinguished by flashings of the eye, by
      terror-striking tones of voice, and by the vehement fervour of the man's
      whole being, so he who is inspired by temperate and harmonious love (23)
      will wear a look of kindlier welcome in his eyes; the words he utters fall
      from his lips with softer intonation; and every gesture of his bodily
      frame conform to what is truly frank and liberal. Such, at any rate, the
      strange effects now wrought on Callias by love. He was like one
      transformed, the cynosure of all initiated in the mysteries of this
      divinity. (24)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (23) Cf. Plat. "Rep." iii. 403 A: "Whereas true love is a love of
    beauty and order, temperate and harmonious."

 (24) Cf. "Econ." xxi. 12.
</pre>
    <p>
      So they supped in silence, the whole company, as if an injunction had been
      laid upon them by some superior power. But presently there came a knocking
      on the door! Philippus the jester bade the doorkeeper (25) announce him,
      with apologies for seeking a night's lodging: (26) he had come, he said,
      provided with all necessaries for dining, at a friend's expense: his
      attendant was much galled with carrying, nothing but an empty
      bread-basket. (27) To this announcement Callias, appealing to his guests,
      replied: "It would never do to begrudge the shelter of one's roof: (28)
      let him come in." And as he spoke, he glanced across to where Autolycus
      was seated, as if to say: "I wonder how you take the jest."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (25) Lit. "him who answers the knock," "the concierge" or hall-porter.
    Cf. Theophr. "Char." xiv. 7; Aristot. "Oec." i. 6.

 (26) Lit. "and why he wished to put up."

 (27) Lit. "and being breakfastless"; cf. Theocr. i. 51. The jester's
    humour resembles Pistol's ("Merry Wives," i. 3. 23) "O base
    Hungarian wight!"

 (28) Or, "How say you, my friends, it would hardly do, methinks, to
    shut the door upon him." See Becker, "Charicles," p. 92.
</pre>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the jester, standing at the door of the apartment where the
      feast was spread, addressed the company:
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe you know, sirs, that being a jester by profession, it is my
      business to make jokes. I am all the readier, therefore, to present
      myself, feeling convinced it is a better joke to come to dinner thus
      unbidden than by solemn invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be seated, (29) then (replied the host). The company are fully fed on
      serious thoughts, you see, if somewhat starved of food for laughter.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (29) Lit. "Pray, find a couch then."
</pre>
    <p>
      The feast proceeded; and, if only to discharge the duty laid upon him at a
      dinner-party, Philippus must try at once to perpetrate a jest. Failing to
      stir a smile, poor fellow, he made no secret of his perturbation.
      Presently he tried again; and for the second time the joke fell flat.
      Whereat he paused abruptly in the middle of the course, and muffling up
      his face, fell prostrate on the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Callias: What ails you, sirrah? Have you the cramp? the toothache?
      what?
    </p>
    <p>
      To which the other heaving a deep groan: Yes, Callias, an atrocious ache;
      since laughter has died out among mankind, my whole estate is bankrupt.
      (30) In old days I would be asked to dinner to amuse the company with
      jests. (31) Now all is changed, and who will be at pains to ask me out to
      dinner any more? I might as well pretend to be immortal as to be serious.
      Nor will any one invite me in hopes of reclining at my board in his turn.
      Everyone knows so serious a thing as dinner in my house was never heard
      of; it's against the rules&mdash;the more's the pity.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (30) Cf. "Cyrop." VI. i. 3; Plat. "Laws," 677 C.

 (31) Lit. "by the laughter which I stirred in them."
</pre>
    <p>
      And as he spoke he blew his nose and snuffled, uttering the while so truly
      dolorous a moan (32) that everybody fell to soothing him. "They would all
      laugh again another day," they said, and so implored him to have done and
      eat his dinner; till Critobulus could not stand his lamentation longer,
      but broke into a peal of laughter. The welcome sound sufficed. The
      sufferer unveiled his face, and thus addressed his inner self: (33) "Be of
      good cheer, my soul, there are many battles (34) yet in store for us," and
      so he fell to discussing the viands once again.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (32) Philippus would seem to have anticipated Mr. Woodward; see
    Prologue to "She Stoops to Conquer":
</pre>
    <p>
      Pray, would you know the reason I'm crying? The Comic Muse long sick is
      now a-dying! And if she goes...

    the double sense of {sumbolai}. Cf. Aristoph. "Ach." 1210, where
    Lamachus groans {talas ego xumboles bareias}, and Dicaeopolis
    replies {tois Khousi gar tis xumbolas epratteto}.

      Now the tables were removed, and in due order they had poured out the
      libation, and had sung the hymn. (1) To promote the revelry, there entered
      now a Syracusan, with a trio of assistants: the first, a flute-girl,
      perfect in her art; and next, a dancing-girl, skilled to perform all kinds
      of wonders; lastly, in the bloom of beauty, a boy, who played the harp and
      danced with infinite grace. This Syracusan went about exhibiting his
      troupe, whose wonderful performance was a source of income to him.

<pre xml:space="preserve">

</pre>
    <p>
      After the girl had played to them upon the flute, and then the boy in turn
      upon the harp, and both performers, as it would appear, had set the hearts
      of every one rejoicing, Socrates turned to Callias:
    </p>
    <p>
      A feast, upon my word, O princeliest entertainer! (2) Was it not enough to
      set before your guests a faultless dinner, but you must feast our eyes and
      ears on sights and sounds the most delicious?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (2) Lit. "in consummate style."
</pre>
    <p>
      To which the host: And that reminds me, a supply of unguents might not be
      amiss; (3) what say you? Shall we feast on perfumes also? (4)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (3) Lit. "suppose I tell the servant to bring in some perfumes, so
    that we may further feast on fragrance..." Cf. Theophr. "Char."
    vii. 6 (Jebb ad loc.)

 (4) See Athen. xv. 686.
</pre>
    <p>
      No, I protest (the other answered). Scents resemble clothes. One dress is
      beautiful on man and one on woman; and so with fragrance: what becomes the
      woman, ill becomes the man. Did ever man anoint himself with oil of myrrh
      to please his fellow? Women, and especially young women (like our two
      friends' brides, Niceratus' and Critobulus'), need no perfume, being but
      compounds themselves of fragrance. (5) No, sweeter than any perfume else
      to women is good olive-oil, suggestive of the training-school: (6) sweet
      if present, and when absent longed for. And why? Distinctions vanish with
      the use of perfumes. The freeman and the slave have forthwith both alike
      one odour. But the scents derived from toils&mdash;those toils which every
      free man loves (7)&mdash;need customary habit first, and time's
      distillery, if they are to be sweet with freedom's breath, at last. (8)

 (5) Cf. Solomon's Song, iv. 10: "How fair is thy love, my sister, my
    spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of
    thine ointments than all spices!"

 (6) Lit. "the gymnasium."

 (7) Cf. Aristoph. "Clouds," 1002 foll. See J. A. Symonds, "The Greek
    Poets," 1st s., p. 281.

 (8) See "Mem." III. x. 5; "Cyrop." VIII. i. 43.
</pre>
    <p>
      Here Lycon interposed: That may be well enough for youths, but what shall
      we do whose gymnastic days are over? What fragrance is left for us?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Why, that of true nobility, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lyc. And whence shall a man obtain this chrism?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Not from those that sell perfumes and unguents, in good sooth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lyc. But whence, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Theognis has told us:

      his heart on carrying off the palm of victory in the pankration, he took
      you into his counsel; (10) and will again take counsel to discover the

      Then Socrates: The question would seem at any rate to be debatable.

      the programme of proceedings. I see, the dancing-girl is standing ready;
      they are handing her some hoops.

      And at the instant her fellow with the flute commenced a tune to keep her
      company, whilst some one posted at her side kept handing her the hoops
      till she had twelve in all. With these in her hands she fell to dancing,
      and the while she danced she flung the hoops into the air&mdash;overhead

      strength and judgment; (14) and that should be an encouragement to those

      pleased to laugh at me. Pray, do you find it so ridiculous my wishing to
      improve my health by exercise? or to enjoy my victuals better? to sleep
      better? or is it the sort of exercise I set my heart on? Not like those
      runners of the long race, (32) to have my legs grow muscular and my
      shoulders leaner in proportion; nor like a boxer, thickening chest and
      shoulders at expense of legs; but by distribution of the toil throughout
      my limbs (33) I seek to give an even balance to my body. Or are you
      laughing to think that I shall not in future have to seek a partner in the
      training school, (34) whereby it will not be necessary for an old man like
      myself to strip in public? (35) All I shall need will be a seven-sofa'd
      chamber, (36) where I can warm to work, (37) just like the lad here who
      has found this room quite ample for the purpose. And in winter I shall do
      gymnastics (38) under cover, or when the weather is broiling under
      shade.... But what is it you keep on laughing at&mdash;the wish on my part
      to reduce to moderate size a paunch a trifle too rotund? Is that the
      source of merriment? (39) Perhaps you are not aware, my friends, that

      So saying up he got, and mimicked the dances of the boy and girl in
      burlesque fashion, and inasmuch as the spectators had been pleased to
      think the natural beauty of the boy enhanced by every gesture of his body
      in the dance, so the jester must give a counter-representation, (44) in

      At this point Socrates: Nay, gentlemen, if drinking is the order of the
      day, I heartily approve. Wine it is in very truth that moistens the soul
      of man, (46) that lulls at once all cares to sleep, even as mandragora
      (47) drugs our human senses, and at the same time kindles light-hearted
      thoughts, (48) as oil a flame. Yet it fares with the banquets of men, (49)
      if I mistake not, precisely as with plants that spring and shoot on earth.
      When God gives these vegetable growths too full a draught of rain, they
      cannot lift their heads nor feel the light air breathe through them; but
      if they drink in only the glad supply they need, they stand erect, they
      shoot apace, and reach maturity of fruitage. So we, too, if we drench our
      throats with over-copious draughts, (50) ere long may find our legs begin
      to reel and our thoughts begin to falter; (51) we shall scarce be able to
      draw breath, much less to speak a word in season. But if (to borrow
      language from the mint of Gorgias (52)), if only the attendants will bedew
      us with a frequent mizzle (53) of small glasses, we shall not be violently
      driven on by wine to drunkenness, but with sweet seduction reach the goal

      Then Socrates, reverting in a manner to the charge: The young people have

      me to learn the whole of Homer's poems, and it so happens that even now I
      can repeat the "Iliad" and the "Odyssey" by heart. (12)

      You have not forgotten (interposed Antisthenes), perhaps, that besides
      yourself there is not a rhapsodist who does not know these epics?
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgotten! is it likely (he replied), considering I had to listen to them
      almost daily?

    <p>
      It is plain (suggested Socrates), they do not know the underlying meaning.
      (14) But you, Niceratus, have paid large sums of money to Anaximander, and
      Stesimbrotus, and many others, (15) so that no single point in all that
      costly lore is lost upon you. (16) But what (he added, turning to
      Critobulus) do you most pride yourself upon?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (14) i.e. "they haven't the key (of knowledge) to the allegorical or
    spiritual meaning of the sacred text." Cf. Plat. "Crat." 407;
    "Ion," 534; "Rep." 378, 387; "Theaet." 180; "Prot." 316. See
    Grote, "H. G." i. 564.

 (15) See Aristot. "Rhet." iii. 11, 13. "Or we may describe Niceratus
     (not improbably our friend) as a 'Philoctetes stung by Pratys,'
    using the simile of Thrasymachus when he saw Niceratus after his
    defeat by Pratys in the rhapsody with his hair still dishevelled
    and his face unwashed."&mdash;Welldon. As to Stesimbrotus, see Plat.
    "Ion," 530: "Ion. Very true, Socrates; interpretation has
    certainly been the most laborious part of my art; and I believe
    myself able to speak about Homer better than any man; and that
    neither Metrodorus of Lampsacus, nor Stesimbrotus of Thasos, nor
    Glaucon, nor any one else who ever was, had as good ideas about
    Homer, or as many of them, as I have."&mdash;Jowett. Anaximander,
    probably of Lampsacus, the author of a {'Erologia}; see Cobet,
    "Pros. Xen." p. 8.

 (16) Or, "you will not have forgotten one point of all that precious
    teaching." Like Sir John Falstaff's page (2 "Henry IV." ii. 2.
    100), Niceratus, no doubt, has got many "a crown's worth of good
    interpretations."

      On beauty (answered Critobulus).
    </p>
    <p>
      What (Socrates rejoined), shall you be able to maintain that by your
      beauty you can make us better?

      Soc. Well, and what is it you pride yourself upon, Antisthenes?
    </p>
    <p>
      On wealth (he answered).

    <p>
      Oh, I, for my part, pride myself on poverty (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon my word, a charming business! (exclaimed Socrates). Poverty! of all
      things the least liable to envy; seldom, if ever, an object of contention;
      (20) never guarded, yet always safe; the more you starve it, the stronger
      it grows.

      Then he, with knitted brows, quite solemnly: On pandering. (21) And when
      they laughed to hear him say this, (22) he continued: Laugh to your hearts

      to practise this same art.

      At this point Lycon, turning to Philippus: We need not ask you what you

    </p>
    <p>
      Yes (he answered), and with better right, I fancy, than Callippides, (23)

      he alone can set the crowds a-weeping in the theatre. (24)

    <p>
      And now you, Lycon, tell us, won't you (asked Antisthenes), what it is you
      take the greatest pride in?
    </p>
    <p>
      You all of you, I fancy, know already what that is (the father answered);
      it is in my son here.

      And the lad himself (some one suggested) doubtless prides himself, beyond
      all else, on having won the prize of victory.

      No indeed, not I.

      The company were charmed to hear him speak, and turned and looked; and

      To which he answered: On my father (and leaned closer towards him).

      richest man in the whole world, Lycon?

    <p>
      To which Lycon: Really, I was not aware of that before.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the virtue and the power of my friends (he answered), and that being
      what they are, they care for me.

      At this point, Socrates took up the conversation: It now devolves on us to
      prove in turn that what we each have undertaken to defend is really
      valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Callias: Be pleased to listen to me first: My case is this, that
      while the rest of you go on debating what justice and uprightness are, (1)
      I spend my time in making men more just and upright.

      Antisthenes sprang to his feet at once, and with the manner of a

      their souls, or in their purses, (2) Callias?
    </p>

</pre>
    <p>
      Call. In their souls.

      Ant. And do you pretend to make their souls more righteous by putting
      money in their pockets?
    </p>
    <p>
      Call. Undoubtedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ant. Pray how?
    </p>
    <p>
      Call. In this way. When they know that they are furnished with the means,
      that is to say, my money, to buy necessaries, they would rather not incur
      the risk of evil-doing, and why should they?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ant. And pray, do they repay you these same moneys?
    </p>
    <p>
      Call. I cannot say they do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ant. Well then, do they requite your gifts of gold with gratitude?
    </p>
    <p>
      Call. No, not so much as a bare "Thank you." In fact, some of them are
      even worse disposed towards me when they have got my money than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, here's a marvel! (exclaimed Antisthenes, and as he spoke he eyed the
      witness with an air of triumph). You can render people just to all the
      world, but towards yourself you cannot?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pray, where's the wonder? (asked the other). Do you not see what scores of
      carpenters and house-builders there are who spend their time in building
      houses for half the world; but for themselves they simply cannot do it,
      and are forced to live in lodgings. And so admit that home-thrust, Master

    <p>
      Thereupon Niceratus: Lend me your ears, and I will tell you in what
      respects you shall be better for consorting with myself. I presume,
      without my telling you, you know that Homer, being the wisest of mankind,
      has touched upon nearly every human topic in his poems. (6) Whosoever
      among you, therefore, would fain be skilled in economy, or oratory, or
      strategy; whose ambition it is to be like Achilles, or Ajax, Nestor, or
      Odysseus&mdash;one and all pay court to me, for I have all this knowledge
      at my fingers' ends.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (6) Or, "his creations are all but coextensive with every mortal
    thing."
</pre>
    <p>
      Pray (interposed Antisthenes), (7) do you also know the way to be a king?
      (8) since Homer praises Agamemnon, you are well aware, as being
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    A goodly king and eke a spearman bold. (9)

 (7) Some modern critics (e.g. F. Dummler, "Antisthenica," p. 29 foll.)
    maintain plausibly that the author is here glancing (as also Plato
    in the "Ion") at Antisthenes' own treatises against the
    Rhapsodists and on a more correct interpretation of Homer, {peri

      I know another thing besides, and you may put it to the test this instant,

    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    And at his side an onion, which to drink gives relish.

    <p>
      So if some one will but bring an onion, you shall reap the benefit of my

      No fear of that (rejoined Niceratus). Always take a bite of onion before
      speeding forth to battle, just as your patrons of the cock-pit give their

      After such sort the theme of their discourse reached its conclusion.

    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (19) See "Hellenica Essays," p. 353.
</pre>
    <p>
      A chorus of voices rejoined: Say on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crit. To begin with, if I am not beautiful, as methinks I be, you will
      bring on your own heads the penalty of perjury; for, without waiting to
      have the oath administered, you are always taking the gods to witness that
      you find me beautiful. And I must needs believe you, for are you not all
      honourable men? (20) If I then be so beautiful and affect you, even as I
      also am affected by him whose fair face here attracts me, (21) I swear by
      all the company of heaven I would not choose the great king's empire in
      exchange for what I am&mdash;the beauty of the world, the paragon of
      animals. (22) And at this instant I feast my eyes on Cleinias (23)
      gladlier than on all other sights which men deem fair. Joyfully will I
      welcome blindness to all else, if but these eyes may still behold him and
      him only. With sleep and night I am sore vexed, which rob me of his sight;
      but to daylight and the sun I owe eternal thanks, for they restore him to
      me, my heart's joy, Cleinias. (24)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (20) Or, "beautiful and good."

 (21) Or, "whose fair face draws me." Was Cleinias there as a "muta
    persona"? Hardly, in spite of {nun}. It is the image of him which
    is present to the mind's eye.

 (22) Lit. "being beautiful"; but there is a touch of bombast infused
    into the speech by the artist. Cf. the speech of Callias ("Hell."
    VI. iii. 3) and, for the humour, "Cyrop." passim.

 (23) See Cobet, "Pros. Xen." p. 59. Cf. "Mem." I. iii. 8.

 (24) Or, "for that they reveal his splendour to me."
</pre>
    <p>
      Yes, and herein also have we, the beautiful, (25) just claim to boast. The
      strong man may by dint of toil obtain good things; the brave, by danger
      boldly faced, and the wise by eloquence of speech; but to the beautiful
      alone it is given to achieve all ends in absolute quiescence. To take
      myself as an example. I know that riches are a sweet possession, yet
      sweeter far to me to give all that I have to Cleinias than to receive a
      fortune from another. Gladly would I become a slave&mdash;ay, forfeit
      freedom&mdash;if Cleinias would deign to be my lord. Toil in his service
      were easier for me than rest from labour: danger incurred in his behalf
      far sweeter than security of days. So that if you, Callias, may boast of
      making men more just and upright, to me belongs by juster right than yours
      to train mankind to every excellence. We are the true inspirers (26) who
      infuse some subtle fire into amorous souls, we beauties, and thereby raise
      them to new heights of being; we render them more liberal in the pursuit
      of wealth; we give them a zest for toil that mocks at danger, and enables
      them where honour the fair vision leads, to follow. (27) We fill their
      souls with deeper modesty, a self-constraint more staunch; about the
      things they care for most, there floats a halo of protecting awe. (28)
      Fools and unwise are they who choose not beauteous men to be their
      generals. How merrily would I, at any rate, march through fire by the side
      of Cleinias; (29) and so would all of you, I know full well, in company of
      him who now addresses you.

      Cease, therefore, your perplexity, O Socrates, abandon fears and doubts,
      believe and know that this thing of which I make great boast, my beauty,
      has power to confer some benefit on humankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more, let no man dare dishonour beauty, merely because the flower of
      it soon fades, since even as a child has growth in beauty, so is it with
      the stripling, the grown man, the reverend senior. (30) And this the proof
      of my contention. Whom do we choose to bear the sacred olive-shoot (31) in
      honour of Athena?&mdash;whom else save beautiful old men? witnessing
      thereby (32) that beauty walks hand in hand as a companion with every age
      of life, from infancy to eld.

      Or again, if it be sweet to win from willing hearts the things we seek
      for, I am persuaded that, by the eloquence of silence, I could win a kiss

      of half a hundred subtle arguments.

      beauty. Judgment shall be given&mdash;not at the bar of Alexander, son of
      Priam&mdash;but of these (35) who, as you flatter yourself, have such a
      hankering to kiss you.

      Oh, Socrates (he answered, deprecatingly), will you not leave it to the
      arbitrament of Cleinias?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Socrates: Will you never tire of repeating that one name? It is
      Cleinias here, there, and everywhere with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crit. And if his name died on my lips, think you my mind would less recall
      his memory? Know you not, I bear so clear an image of him in my soul, that
      had I the sculptor's or the limner's skill, I might portray his features
      as exactly from this image of the mind as from contemplation of his actual
      self.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Socrates broke in: Pray, why then, if you bear about this lively
      image, why do you give me so much trouble, dragging me to this and that
      place, where you hope to see him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Crit. For this good reason, Socrates, the sight of him inspires gladness,
      whilst his phantom brings not joy so much as it engenders longing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point Hermogenes protested: I find it most unlike you, Socrates,
      to treat thus negligently one so passion-crazed as Critobulus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Socrates replied: Do you suppose the sad condition of the patient dates
      from the moment only of our intimacy?
    </p>
    <p>
      Herm. Since when, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Since when? Why, look at him: the down begins to mantle on his
      cheeks, (36) and on the nape (37) of Cleinias' neck already mounts. The
      fact is, when they fared to the same school together, he caught the fever.
      This his father was aware of, and consigned him to me, hoping I might be
      able to do something for him. Ay, and his plight is not so sorry now. Once
      he would stand agape at him like one whose gaze is fixed upon the Gorgons,
      (38) his eyes one stony stare, and like a stone himself turn heavily away.
      But nowadays I have seen the statue actually blink. (39) And yet, may
      Heaven help me! my good sirs, I think, between ourselves, the culprit must
      have bestowed a kiss on Cleinias, than which love's flame asks no fiercer
      fuel. (40) So insatiable a thing it is and so suggestive of mad fantasy.
      (And for this reason held perhaps in higher honour, because of all
      external acts the close of lip with lip bears the same name as that of
      soul with soul in love.) (41) Wherefore, say I, let every one who wishes
      to be master of himself and sound of soul abstain from kisses imprinted on
      fair lips. (42)

      Charmides responded: On all hands it is admitted, I believe, that

      Well now, I will tell you how it fared with me in this same city when I
      was wealthy. First, I lived in daily terror lest some burglar should break
      into my house and steal my goods and do myself some injury. I cringed
      before informers. (49) I was obliged to pay these people court, because I
      knew that I could injure them far less than they could injure me.
      Never-ending the claims upon my pocket which the state enforced upon me;
      and as to setting foot abroad, that was beyond the range of possibility.
      But now that I have lost my property across the frontier, (50) and derive
      no income from my lands in Attica itself; now that my very household goods
      have been sold up, I stretch my legs at ease, I get a good night's rest.
      The distrust of my fellow-citizens has vanished; instead of trembling at
      threats, it is now my turn to threaten; at last I feel myself a freeman,
      with liberty to go abroad or stay at home as suits my fancy. The tables
      now are turned. It is the rich who rise to give me their seats, who stand
      aside and make way for me as I meet them in the streets. To-day I am like
      a despot, yesterday I was literally a slave; formerly it was I who had to
      pay my tribute (51) to the sovereign people, now it is I who am supported
      by the state by means of general taxation. (52)

    <p>
      And there is another thing. So long as I was rich, they threw in my teeth
      as a reproach that I was friends with Socrates, but now that I am become a
      beggar no one troubles his head two straws about the matter. Once more,
      the while I rolled in plenty I had everything to lose, and, as a rule, I
      lost it; what the state did not exact, some mischance stole from me. But
      now that is over. I lose nothing, having nought to lose; but, on the
      contrary, I have everything to gain, and live in hope of some day getting
      something. (53)

    </p>
    <p>
      Come now (Socrates exclaimed), it lies with you, sir, you, Antisthenes, to
      explain to us, how it is that you, with means so scanty, make so loud a
      boast of wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because (he answered) I hold to the belief, sirs, that wealth and poverty
      do not lie in a man's estate, but in men's souls. Even in private life how
      many scores of people have I seen, who, although they roll in wealth, yet
      deem themselves so poor, there is nothing they will shrink from, neither
      toil nor danger, in order to add a little to their store. (55) I have
      known two brothers, (56) heirs to equal fortunes, one of whom has enough,
      more than enough, to cover his expenditure; the other is in absolute
      indigence. And so to monarchs, there are not a few, I perceive, so
      ravenous of wealth that they will outdo the veriest vagrants in atrocity.
      Want (57) prompts a thousand crimes, you must admit. Why do men steal? why
      break burglariously into houses? why hale men and women captive and make
      slaves of them? Is it not from want? Nay, there are monarchs who at one
      fell swoop destroy whole houses, make wholesale massacre, and oftentimes
      reduce entire states to slavery, and all for the sake of wealth. These I
      must needs pity for the cruel malady which plagues them. Their condition,
      to my mind, resembles that poor creature's who, in spite of all he has
      (58) and all he eats, can never stay the wolf that gnaws his vitals.

      But as to me, my riches are so plentiful I cannot lay my hands on them
      myself; (59) yet for all that I have enough to eat till my hunger is
      stayed, to drink till my thirst is sated; (60) to clothe myself withal;
      and out of doors not Callias there, with all his riches, is more safe than
      I from shivering; and when I find myself indoors, what warmer shirting
      (61) do I need than my bare walls? what ampler greatcoat than the tiles
      above my head? these seem to suit me well enough; and as to bedclothes, I
      am not so ill supplied but it is a business to arouse me in the morning.

      And as to sexual desire, my body's need is satisfied by what comes first
      to hand. Indeed, there is no lack of warmth in the caress which greets me,
      just because it is unsought by others. (62)

      apt to pray for less than more of them, so strongly do I feel that some of
      them are sweeter than what is good for one or profitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of all the precious things in my possession, I reckon this the
      choicest, that were I robbed of my whole present stock, there is no work
      so mean, but it would amply serve me to furnish me with sustenance. Why,
      look you, whenever I desire to fare delicately, I have not to purchase
      precious viands in the market, which becomes expensive, but I open the
      storehouse of my soul, and dole them out. (63) Indeed, as far as pleasure
      goes, I find it better to await desire before I suffer meat or drink to
      pass my lips, than to have recourse to any of your costly viands, as, for
      instance, now, when I have chanced on this fine Thasian wine, (64) and sip
      it without thirst. But indeed, the man who makes frugality, not wealth of
      worldly goods, his aim, is on the face of it a much more upright person.
      And why?&mdash;the man who is content with what he has will least of all
      be prone to clutch at what is his neighbour's.

    <p>
      And here's a point worth noting. Wealth of my sort will make you liberal
      of soul. Look at Socrates; from him it was I got these riches. He did not
      supply me with it by weight or by measure, but just as much as I could
      carry, he with bounteous hand consigned to me. And I, too, grudge it to no
      man now. To all my friends without distinction I am ready to display my
      opulence: come one, come all; and whosoever likes to take a share is
      welcome to the wealth that lies within my soul. Yes, and moreover, that
      most luxurious of possessions, (65) unbroken leisure, you can see, is
      mine, which leaves me free to contemplate things worthy of contemplation,
      (66) and to drink in with my ears all charming sounds. And what I value
      most, freedom to spend whole days in pure scholastic intercourse (67) with
      Socrates, to whom I am devoted. (68) And he, on his side, is not the
      person to admire those whose tale of gold and silver happens to be the
      largest, but those who are well-pleasing to him he chooses for companions,
      and will consort with to the end.

      Herm. That the gods know all things, that the present and the future lie

      is obvious; or else, why do states and nations, one and all, inquire of
      the gods by divination what they ought to do and what they ought not? This
      also is apparent, that we believe them able to do us good and to do us
      harm; or why do all men pray to Heaven to avert the evil and bestow the
      good? Well then, my boast is that these gods, who know and can do all
      things, (72) deign to be my friends; so that, by reason of their care for

      signals, sending messengers, be it some voice, (75) or vision of the
      night, with omens of the solitary bird, which tell me what I should and
      what I should not do. When I listen to their warnings all goes well with

      have been disobedient, chastisement has overtaken me.

      Crit. Well, let that pass. To come to our two noses, which is the more
      handsome, yours or mine?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Mine, I imagine, if, that is, the gods presented us with noses for

      out wide and flat, as if to welcome scents from every quarter.

 (7) Or, "your straight nose." Cf. Plat. "Theaet." 209 C: Soc. "Or, if

    notion of you than myself and others who resemble me?" Cf. also
    Aristot. "Pol." v. 9, 7: "A nose which varies from the ideal of
    straightness to a hook or snub may still be a good shape and
    agreeable to the eye; but if the excess be very great, all
    symmetry is lost, and the nose at last ceases to be a nose at all
    on account of some excess in one direction or defect in the other;
    and this is true of every other part of the human body. The same
    law of proportion holds in states."&mdash;Jowett.

      As to the mouth (proceeded Critobulus), I give in at once; for, given
      mouths are made for purposes of biting, you could doubtless bite off a
      much larger mouthful with your mouth than I with mine.

      you can, thanks to my thick lips.

      Crit. It seems I have an uglier mouth than any ass.
    </p>

      evidence be needed to prove that I am handsomer than you. The naiads,
      nymphs, divine, have as their progeny Sileni, who are much more like
      myself, I take it, than like you. Is that conclusive?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nay, I give it up (cried Critobulus), I have not a word to say in answer.
      I am silenced. Let them record the votes. I fain would know at once what I
      must suffer or must pay. (10) Only (he added) let them vote in secret.

      what it seems to me to be.

    <p>
      Soc. That seems as good. What does it seem?

      Her. A drunken brawl, in my poor judgment, is annoyance caused to people

    <p>
      Her. Then you have not observed that, as to any interval between your
      talk, a man would find it hard to insert a hair, much more one grain of

      his cross-examiner.

      Then Socrates: By all that's holy, I wish you would, Hermogenes. How
      delightful it would be. Just as a song sounds sweeter in concert with the
      flute, so would your talk be more mellifluous attuned to its soft pipings;

      suit the tenor of your speech.

      Thus the stream of talk flowed on; until the Syracusan, who was painfully

    compliment to the showman, it reminds one of Peter Quince's
    commendation of Bottom: "Yea and the best person too; and he is a
    very paramour for a sweet voice."

 (17) It is not easy to keep pace with the merryman's jests; but if I

      The voice of Socrates was heard above the tumult: Since we are all so
      eager to be heard at once, what fitter time than now to sing a song, in
      chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suiting the action to the words, he commenced a stave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The song was barely finished, when a potter's wheel was brought in, on
      which the dancing-girl was to perform more wonders.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point Socrates addressed the man of Syracuse: It seems I am likely
      to deserve the title which you gave me of a thinker in good earnest. Just
      now I am speculating by what means your boy and girl may pass a happy
      time, and we spectators still derive the greatest pleasure from beholding
      them; and this, I take it, is precisely what you would yourself most wish.
      Now I maintain, that throwing somersaults in and out of swords is a
      display of danger uncongenial to a banquet. And as for writing and reading
      on a wheel that all the while keeps whirling, I do not deny the wonder of
      it, but what pleasure such a marvel can present, I cannot for the life of
      me discover. Nor do I see how it is a whit more charming to watch these
      fair young people twisting about their bodies and imitating wheels than to
      behold them peacefully reposing.

      We need not fare far afield to light on marvels, if that is our object.
      All about us here is full of marvel; we can begin at once by wondering,
      why it is the candle gives a light by dint of its bright flame, while side
      by side with it the bright bronze vessel gives no light, but shows within
      itself those other objects mirrored. (1) Or, how is it that oil, being
      moist and liquid, keeps that flame ablaze, but water, just because it is
      liquid, quenches fire. But no more do these same marvels tend to promote
      the object of the wine-cup. (2)

      It were but reasonable, sirs, on our part not to ignore the mighty power
      here present, (3) a divinity in point of age coequal with the everlasting
      gods, yet in outward form the youngest, (4) who in magnitude embraces all
      things, and yet his shrine is planted in the soul of man. Love (5) is his
      name! and least of all should we forget him who are one and all votaries
      of this god. (6) For myself I cannot name the time at which I have not
      been in love with some one. (7) And Charmides here has, to my knowledge,
      captivated many a lover, while his own soul has gone out in longing for
      the love of not a few himself. (8) So it is with Critobulus also; the
      beloved of yesterday is become the lover of to-day. Ay, and Niceratus, as
      I am told, adores his wife, and is by her adored. (9) As to Hermogenes,
      which of us needs to be told (10) that the soul of this fond lover is
      consumed with passion for a fair ideal&mdash;call it by what name you will&mdash;the
      spirit blent of nobleness and beauty. (11) See you not what chaste
      severity dwells on his brow; (12) how tranquil his gaze; (13) how moderate
      his words; how gentle his intonation; now radiant his whole character. And
      if he enjoys the friendship of the most holy gods, he keeps a place in his
      regard for us poor mortals. But how is it that you alone, Antisthenes, you
      misanthrope, love nobody?

      yourselves illustrious. For my part I have ever admired your nature, but
      now much more so, when I see that you are in love with one who does not
      wanton in luxury or languish in effeminacy, (18) but who displays to all
      his strength, his hardihood, his courage, and sobriety of soul. To be
      enamoured of such qualities as these is a proof itself of a true lover's

      Whether indeed Aphrodite be one or twain (19) in personality, the heavenly

      separate altars, shrines, and sacrifices, (21) as befits their nature&mdash;she
      that is earthly, of a lighter and a laxer sort; she that is heavenly,
      purer and holier in type. And you may well conjecture, it is the earthly
      goddess, the common Aphrodite, who sends forth the bodily loves; while
      from her that is named of heaven, Ourania, proceed those loves which feed
      upon the soul, on friendship and on noble deeds. It is by this latter,
      Callias, that you are held in bonds, if I mistake not, Love divine. (22)
      This I infer as well from the fair and noble character of your friend, as
      from the fact that you invite his father to share your life and

      Without friendship, (25) as we full well know, there is no society of any

      admiration (26) is bestowed upon the inner disposition, it is well named a
      sweet and voluntary compulsion. But among those whose desire (26) is for
      the body, there are not a few who blame, nay hate, the ways of their
      beloved ones. And even where attachment (26) clings to both, (27) even so
      the bloom of beauty after all does quickly reach its prime; the flower
      withers, and when that fails, the affection which was based upon it must
      also wither up and perish. But the soul, with every step she makes in her

      such a being will, of course, admire and fondly cling to his beloved, is a
      thesis which needs no further argument on my part. Rather I will essay to
      teach you, how it is natural that this same type of lover should in turn
      be loved by his soul's idol. (34)

      How, in the first place, is it possible for him to hate a lover who, he

      estate of him he loves (36) than to indulge his selfish joys? and above
      all, when he has faith and trust that neither dereliction, (37) nor loss

      endures make merry cheer, day in day out; or if either of them should fall
      on sickness, then will their intercourse be yet more constant; and if they
      cared for one another face to face, much more will they care when parted.
      (39) Are not all these the outward tokens of true loveliness? (40) In the

      is not fair, and hot lips are pressed to cold. Between man and woman it is
      different. There the wife at any rate shares with her husband in their

      I have next to show that the society of him whose love is of the body, not

      the path of virtue, who will teach us excellence, whether of speech or
      conduct, (45) may well be honoured, even as Cheiron and Phoenix (46) were
      honoured by Achilles. But what can he expect, who stretches forth an eager
      hand to clutch the body, save to be treated (47) as a beggar? That is his

      If my language has a touch of turbulence, (49) do not marvel: partly the

      hearts now pricks me forward to use great boldness of speech (50) against
      his base antagonist. Why, yes indeed, it seems to me that he who fixes his
      mind on outward beauty is like a man who has taken a farm on a short
      lease. He shows no anxiety to improve its value; his sole object being to
      take off it the largest crops he can himself. But he whose heart is set on
      loyal friendship resembles rather a man who has a farmstead of his own. At
      any rate, he scours the wide world to find what may enhance the value of
      his soul's delight. (51)

      Again, let us consider the effect upon the object of attachment. Let him
      but know his beauty is a bond sufficient to enthrall his lover, (52) and
      what wonder if he be careless of all else and play the wanton. Let him
      discover, on the contrary, that if he would retain his dear affection he
      must himself be truly good and beautiful, and it is only natural he should
      become more studious of virtue. But the greatest blessing which descends
      on one beset with eager longing to convert the idol of his soul into a
      good man and true friend is this: necessity is laid upon himself to
      practise virtue; since how can he hope to make his comrade good, if he
      himself works wickedness? Is it conceivable that the example he himself
      presents of what is shameless and incontinent, (53) will serve to make the
      beloved one temperate and modest?

      I have a longing, Callias, by mythic argument (54) to show you that not

      than bodily enjoyment. Thus those fair women (55) whom Zeus, enamoured of
      their outward beauty, wedded, he permitted mortal to remain; but those
      heroes whose souls he held in admiration, these he raised to immortality.
      Of whom are Heracles and the Dioscuri, and there are others also named.
      (56) As I maintain, it was not for his body's sake, but for his soul's,
      that Ganymede (57) was translated to Olympus, as the story goes, by Zeus.

      Nay, take the fair deeds of to-day: and you shall find them wrought rather
      for the sake of praise by volunteers in toil and peril, than by men
      accustomed to choose pleasure in place of honour. And yet Pausanias, (64)
      the lover of the poet Agathon, (65) making a defence in behalf (66) of
      some who wallow in incontinence, has stated that an army composed of
      lovers and beloved would be invincible. (67) These, in his opinion, would,
      from awe of one another, have the greatest horror of destruction. A truly
      marvellous argument, if he means that men accustomed to turn deaf ears to
      censure and to behave to one another shamelessly, are more likely to feel
      ashamed of doing a shameful deed. He adduced as evidence the fact that the
      Thebans and the Eleians (68) recognise the very principle, and added:
      Though they sleep inarmed, they do not scruple to range the lover side by
      side with the beloved one in the field of battle. An instance which I take
      to be no instance, or at any rate one-sided, (69) seeing that what they
      look upon as lawful with us is scandalous. (70) Indeed, it strikes me that
      this vaunted battle-order would seem to argue some mistrust on their part
      who adopt it&mdash;a suspicion that their bosom friends, once separated
      from them, may forget to behave as brave men should. But the men of
      Lacedaemon, holding that "if a man but lay his hand upon the body and for
      lustful purpose, he shall thereby forfeit claim to what is beautiful and
      noble"&mdash;do, in the spirit of their creed, contrive to mould and
      fashion their "beloved ones" to such height of virtue, (71) that should
      these find themselves drawn up with foreigners, albeit no longer side by
      side with their own lovers, (72) conscience will make desertion of their
      present friends impossible. Self-respect constrains them: since the
      goddess whom the men of Lacedaemon worship is not "Shamelessness," but
      "Reverence." (73)

    from all dishonour, and emulating one another in honour; and when
    fighting at one another's side, although not a mere handful, they
    would overcome the world. For what lover would not choose rather
    to be seen by all mankind than by his beloved, either when
    abandoning his post or throwing away his arms? He would be ready
    to die a thousand deaths rather than endure this. Or would desert
    his beloved or fail him in the hour of danger? The veriest coward
    would become an inspired hero, equal to the bravest, at such a

      On such a note he ended his discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that, Autolycus, whose hour for walking exercise had now come, arose.
      His father, Lycon, was about to leave the room along with him, but before
      so doing, turned to Socrates, remarking:
    </p>
    <p>
      By Hera, Socrates, if ever any one deserved the appellation "beautiful and
      good," (1) you are that man!

    <p>
      So the pair departed. After they were gone, a sort of throne was first
      erected in the inner room abutting on the supper chamber. Then the
      Syracusan entered, with a speech:
    </p>
    <p>
      With your good pleasure, sirs, Ariadne is about to enter the bridal
      chamber set apart for her and Dionysus. Anon Dionysus will appear, fresh
      from the table of the gods, wine-flushed, and enter to his bride. In the
      last scene the two will play (2) with one another.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (2) {paixountai}. The Syracusan naturally uses the Doric form. See
    Cobet, "Pros. Xen." p. 16, note 23. Rutherford, "N. Phrynicus," p.
    91.
</pre>
    <p>
      He had scarce concluded, when Ariadne entered, attired like a bride. She
      crossed the stage and sate herself upon the throne. Meanwhile, before the
      god himself appeared a sound of flutes was heard; the cadence of the
      Bacchic air proclaimed his coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point the company broke forth in admiration of the ballet-master.
      For no sooner did the sound of music strike upon the ear of Ariadne than
      something in her action revealed to all the pleasure which it caused her.
      She did not step forward to meet her lover, she did not rise even from her
      seat; but the flutter of her unrest was plain to see. (3)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (3) Lit. "the difficulty she had to keep so still was evident."
</pre>
    <p>
      When Dionysus presently caught sight of her he loved, lightly he danced
      towards her, and with show of tenderest passion gently reclined upon her
      knees; his arms entwined about her lovingly, and upon her lips he sealed a
      kiss; (4)&mdash;she the while with most sweet bashfulness was fain to wind
      responsive arms about her lover; till the banqueters, the while they gazed
      all eyes, clapped hands and cried "Encore!" But when Dionysus rose upon
      his feet, and rising lifted Ariadne to her full height, the action of
      those lovers as they kissed and fondled one another was a thing to
      contemplate. (5) As to the spectators, they could see that Dionysus was
      indeed most beautiful, and Ariadne like some lovely blossom; nor were
      those mocking gestures, but real kisses sealed on loving lips; and so, (6)
      with hearts aflame, they gazed expectantly. They could hear the question
      asked by Dionysus, did she love him? and her answer, as prettily she swore
      she did. And withal so earnestly, not Dionysus only, but all present, had
      sworn an oath in common: the boy and girl were verily and indeed a pair of
      happy lovers. So much less did they resemble actors, trained to certain
      gestures, than two beings bent on doing what for many a long day they had
      set their hearts on.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 (4) Or, "and encircling his arms about her impressed upon her lips a
    kiss."

 (5) Or, "then was it possible to see the more than mimic gestures."

 (6) Or, "on the tiptoe of excitement." Cf. "Hell." III. i. 14, iv. 2.
</pre>
    <p>
      At last when these two lovers, caught in each other's arms, were seen to
      be retiring to the nuptial couch, the members of the supper party turned
      to withdraw themselves; and whilst those of them who were unmarried swore
      that they would wed, those who were wedded mounted their horses and
      galloped off to join their wives, in quest of married joys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Socrates, and of the rest the few who still remained behind, anon set
      off with Callias, to see out Lycon and his son, and share the walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so this supper party, assembled in honour of Autolycus, broke up.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
